    <section class = "about">
      <p id = "subtitle3">I'm a junior at UCSD, double majoring in Mathematics-Computer Science and Machine Learning. I previously worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Meetomate and am currently active in various campus organizations. I'm passionate about my field and thrive on keeping myself busy as I work toward my professional goals. I dedicate much of my time to LeetCode and exploring ways to improve myself and my skills. My goal is to begin my career as a software engineer, mastering system development, and eventually transition into a machine learning engineer to contribute to advancing a more technology-driven world. Outside of academics and work, I enjoy swimming, working out, and spending quality time with family and friends. Quality time is one of my core values, and staying connected with loved ones is crucial to my everyday life.</p>
